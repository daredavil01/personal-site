# Intro

I am software developer specialiazed in full-stack development. Since college days, I find myself to be inclined towards technology, society, psychology, blogging, desigining, video editing, digital well-being, in short towards variety of issues, technologies, topics and interests.

This has culminated in all-round interest across podcasts, development, writing, reading and much more! Also, all this exploration has helped me to decide what I am good at, what I am not good at, what I like, what I don't like and most importantly what I wish to do in my career and what I don't want to do.

And, here's  what I wish to do: critically engage in new developments across technology, better thou-self everyday, learn something about stuff happening around me, understand it and enjoy this meaningfull and purposefull journey! Interested in any of above topics, get in touch if you wish to engage!

# Currently
