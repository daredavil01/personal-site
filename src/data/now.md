## Archives

This will be a section of archival notes.

## November 2025

- _Vibe-coding_: Built **Get Me My Training Plan!** at the AI Study Group organized by `Aditya Kabra` and `Manasi Kabra`. It's a tool for runners to generate personalized Half/Full Marathon training plans based on recent race times. (Check it out [here](https://runningplan1.netlify.app/)!)
- _Website Update_: Revamped my personal homepage and added this **Now** page to share "unknown unknowns" of my life! Check out my profile on [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/p/R521). Inspired by [Sai Rahul Poruri](https://nownownow.com/p/VXc2).
- _Certificate_: Received the **Bharat AI Enthusiast/Expert Certificate** from NPCI for the Bharat AI Quest at IIT Bombay. It was a great experience connecting with folks like Rahul Vyas and Shraman Lahiri. (Check out the [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sankettambare_bharat-ai-quest-certificat-sanket-tambare-activity-7394029638278258688-BzEH))
- _Book Review_: Finished **The Anxious Generation** by Jonathan Haidt. It explains exactly why our focus is fragmenting as we shift from a "play-based" to a "phone-based" existence. (Read my full takeaway [here](https://sankettambare.substack.com/p/book-review-the-anxious-generation))
- _Book Review_: Finished **Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism** by Sarah Wynn-Williams. One fascinating thing about understanding different large scale technology mis-use is understanding way they are orchestrated! Be it Cambridge Analytica, Pegasus Spyware, Permanent Record by Edward Snowden or anything else! The book explores multiple situations including 2016 US elections, Myanmar Massacre, FB in China and many more! Definitely interesting one, detailed blog coming soon!
- _Certificate_: Completed the **Politics and Policy of AI** expert capsule course by **The Takshashila Institution**. The course covered "Demystifying AI", "The Politics, Policy and Governance of AI", and "Geopolitics of AI". It highlighted how AI's evolution differs from past industrial revolutions due to its unpredictable pace and impact. This course provided a new vision for navigating the rough terrain of AI policy.
