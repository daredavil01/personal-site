## What's this and why is it here?

One day, I was scrolling through LinkedIn and found a post by [Rahul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahulporuri/), stating that he had started a new page on his website called Now. I thought, 'I have a website, let's add this to the website!'

- Events

## What was I doing last month (October, 2025)

- _4th-5th October_: **Bharat AI Quest** at `IIT Bombay`, organised by `NPCI` and workshop supported by `Nvidia`

  - Attended the two-day _Bharat AI Quest_ at `IIT Bombay`, an event organised by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) as part of the Global Fintech Fest. ([linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7380841678447910912/) here!)
  - Day 1: Consisted of a data science hackathon focused on fraud detection and predicting user TPAPs (e.g., Gpay, Phonepe). A key challenge was the restricted coding environment, which lacked auto-complete, Google, and other AI tools.
  - Day 2: Featured an advanced AI workshop by NVIDIA. This session covered deploying LLMs, React agents, NAT, and using Nvidia H100 GPUs.

  - The Collection of Random Thoughts, that I think will culminate into something interesting!
